# Ontology

Based on the collection of the city websites, a city has:
- a name -> other alternative names
- a skyline picture (or a representative photo)
- a geography and demography introduction (with a geographic picture)
- economy
- climate
- history
- festival (with pictures)
- attractions (with pictures)
- cuisine (with pictures)

# Taxonomy

 City name (a photo)
  - Overview
 > - Geograghics and Demographics (a map)
 > - Climate
 - History
 - Economy
 - Attractions (photos)
 - Local Customs
 > - Festivals (photos)
 > - cuisine (photos)

# Choreography
The order of the content for one city would be represented as that in taxonomy. It is basically following the Category and Hierarchy framework order. Also, I would prefer the logic flow from general to detail, and from strong facts to cultural features.

I think it is easier and more reasonable to arrange the all four cities in Alphabet order. Most of the cities are located far away from each other and it is hard to find a pattern. (But Location order might be a good choice if those cities are located in closed areas, i.e. the USA, the DC world.)
