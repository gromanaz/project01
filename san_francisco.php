    <div id="Climate" class="w3-container menu w3-padding-48 w3-card">
      <p>
        San Francisco has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate characteristic of California's coast, with moist mild winters and dry summers. San Francisco's weather is strongly influenced by the cool currents of the Pacific Ocean on the west side of the city, and the water of San Francisco Bay to the north and east. This moderates temperature swings and produces a remarkably mild year-round climate with little seasonal temperature variation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Among major U.S. cities, San Francisco has the coolest daily mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures for June, July, and August. During the summer, rising hot air in California's interior valleys creates a low pressure area that draws winds from the North Pacific High through the Golden Gate, which creates the city's characteristic cool winds and fog. The fog is less pronounced in eastern neighborhoods and during the late summer and early fall. As a result, the year's warmest month, on average, is September, and on average, October is warmer than July, especially in daytime.

        Transit is the most used form of transportation every day in San Francisco. Every weekday, more than 560,000 people travel on Muni’s 69 bus routes and more than 140,000 customers ride the Muni Metro light rail system. 32% of San Francisco residents use public transportation for their daily commute to work, ranking it first on the West Coast and third overall in the United States. The San Francisco Municipal Railway, primarily known as Muni, is the primary public transit system of San Francisco.
      </p>

      <p>
        Muni is the seventh-largest transit system in the United States, with 210,848,310 rides in 2006. The system operates a combined light rail and subway system, the Muni Metro, as well as large bus and trolley coach networks. Additionally, it runs a historic streetcar line, which runs on Market Street from Castro Street to Fisherman's Wharf. It also operates the famous cable cars, which have been designated as a National Historic Landmark and are a major tourist attraction.

      <p>
        The earliest archaeological evidence of human habitation of the territory of the city of San Francisco dates to 3000 BC. The Yelamu group of the Ohlone people resided in a few small villages when an overland Spanish exploration party, led by Don Gaspar de Portolá, arrived on November 2, 1769, the first documented European visit to San Francisco Bay.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first maritime presence occurred on August 5, 1775, when San Carlos - commanded by Juan Manuel de Ayala - became the first ship to anchor in the bay. The following year, on March 28, 1776, the Spanish established the Presidio of San Francisco, followed by a mission, Mission San Francisco de Así­s (Mission Dolores), established by the Spanish explorer Juan Bautista de Anza.

      <h4>Golden Gate Bridge</h4>
      <img src="assets/san_francisco_golden_gate_bridge.jpg" alt="San Francisco - Attraction">

      <p>
        The Golden Gate Bridge's vaulting, orange arches amidst the rocky seascape of the San Francisco Bay have made it one of the West Coast's most enduring symbols and the city's most popular tourist attraction. The bridge's name, "Golden Gate," actually refers to the body of water it spans (the Golden Gate Strait that connects the Pacific Ocean with the San Francisco Bay), and was built to make travel between San Francisco and Marin County an easier feat.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are plenty of great spots to capture a snap of the majestic bridge. But if you want a truly postcard-worthy shot, head to the Golden Gate Bridge Vista Point, situated high on a hill overlooking San Francisco. If you have extra time, make sure to explore the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. The actual span of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area encompasses multiple places in San Mateo (south of San Francisco), San Francisco and Marin Counties (Alcatraz and Muir Woods included), but notable parts of this recreation area can be found just a stroll away from the Golden Gate. From the bridge, travelers will find some scenic, bayside trails, some of which lead to secluded beaches, including Kirby Cove and Black Sands Beach. If you really want a trek, journey to the Point Bonita Lighthouse for sweeping views of the bay, found at the very tip of the Golden Gate Strait.

    <h3>Mission-Style Burritos</h3>

    <img src="assets/san_francisco_burritos.jpg" alt="San Francisco - Cuisine">

    <p>
      The Mission-style burrito — or San Francisco burrito — was created in the 1960s in The City’s Mission District. There are two theories as to when and where the first one was served: September 26, 1961 at El Faro, or at September 29, 1969 at Taqueria La Cumbre. Regardless of who was its originator, the Mission-style burrito has become an indispensable native food for San Franciscans.
    </p>

    <p>
      What sets it apart from the original meat, rice, and beans variety, is that this monster gets super-sized with the addition of extra rice, vegetables, sour cream, and cheese (in a super burrito), and wrapped in a steamed tortilla to keep all the goodness in. Besides El Faro and La Cumbre, another popular burrito institution one should visit to get the traditional Mission style burrito experience is La Taqueria.

    </p>

    <p>
