    <p class="p">Fuzhou was built over 2200 years starting in 202 B.C. by the king of Yue kingdom. The city was not named Fuzhou until 725 A.D. and was named because of its region close to the mountains. The ancient Chinese believe mountains to be a sign of luck so the name can be broken down to understand it’s meaning- “fu” meaning luck and “zhou” meaning region. It is now the capital of southeastern China where it sits on the bank of the large Min River, very close to the East China Sea.

    <p class="p">Sanfang Qixiang is the only remaining old quarter of Fuzhou. Preserving over 200 ancient folk houses mainly from the Ming and Qing dynasties, it is reputed as the “Architecture Museum of the Ming and Qing Dynasties”. Since its construction in the Jin Dynasty, a great many of scholars have lived here. Therefore, Sanfang Qixiang is also known as the origin of history and culture of Fuzhou.
    </p>

    <p class="p">Sanfang Qixiang consists of three lanes, seven alleys and an axis street named Nanhou Street. The three lanes including Yijin Lane, Wenru Lane and Guanglu Lane are to the west of Nanhou Street. The seven alleys are located to the east of Nanhou Street, which are Yangqiao Alley, Langguan Alley, Ta Alley, Huang Alley, Anmin Alley, Gong Alley and Jibi Alley.

    <p class="p">One of the most renowned Fuzhou dishes is Fotiaoqiang (Buddha Jumps Over the wall). It is said to have been created by the wife of a Fuzhou official, who in 1876 was entertaining an important member of the Fujian Government in his home. His wife, who was an excellent cook placed chicken, duck, pork and seafood together into an empty wine jar to simmer following a recipe which was known at the time as 'Full of Blessing and Longevity'. When the dish was served, the visitor praised the aroma and the delicious flavor and was so impressed that when he returned home he asked the cook – Zheng Chunfa to learn how the wife of his host had prepared the food.
     </p>

    <p class="p">Subsequently, Zheng Chunfa adapted the recipe making it yet more fulsome and on the strength of his creation opened a restaurant named Juchunyuan where he served it to the delight of his customers. One day several talented writers to the restaurant and were served with Zheng Chunfa's special version of 'Full of Blessing and Longevity'. When he opened the jar in which it had been cooked, the diners were so taken with the gorgeous smell that one of them wrote a poem about it. In it he said that the smell was so wonderful that even a Buddha would stop pattering and jump over the wall to have a taste. Hence the name 'Buddha Jumps over the Wall'.

    <p class="p">March 31, also the 15th day of the second lunar month, marks Hua Zhao Jie, or the traditional Flower Festival, a day in which Chinese people celebrate the birthday of the flower goddess. On Saturday, a grand cultural event featuring hanfu, or traditional Chinese clothing, was held to celebrate the festival at West Lake Park in Fuzhou, East China's Fujian province. 
    </p>

    <p class="p">The whole event commenced with a ceremony to honor the flower goddess, when 12 young women clad in iridescent hanfu performed a series of rites, including presenting incense, flowers and wine to the goddess, to pray for good luck. Following the ceremony were two games originating from this festival – butterfly catching and a flower lottery drawing that brought the event to a climax. For the latter game, guests took turns to draw lottery cards and then gave various performances according to what was written on the card.
