## Choreography

### Order of Cities

For the order of the cities I would create a category based on location. On which continent are the cities located? This will create subgroups under the umbrella of the continents. As soon as the cities are grouped by continents, continent groups can be sorted from West to East (which should be more intuitive than from East to West or North to South in alignment with the direction of Latin script). Within each continent group, the cities can be sorted either alphabetically or before sorting alphabetically grouped by corresponding countries first.

The complexity of this geographic classification is dependent on the number of cities that will be chosen. Through this orientation from zoomed-out view to smaller and smaller geographic instances, it is easier for the audience to place the city, even before they have read the whole article. Depending on how many cities there are, within the last geographic instance, they can be sorted alphabetically as the geographic relation has already been established and an alphabetical order is easy to digest the audience as a conventional method of ordering items.

### Order of Content about the Cities

The order of the content is based on association of a subtopic with a broader term, for example a description of traditional food is part of the culture of the city whereas a list of its districts and neighborhoods is part of the geography. After basing the first layer on category, the second layer can be based on hierarchy within these categories. Taking the category culture for example, starting with the history would be a good choice because the history is the basis of all cultural associations in the present. The sights, the traditional food, regular events and festivities all resulted from historical traditions.

The principle is if you need further information for this topic, the later in the order it appears. For instance, a picture of a typical dish only makes sense to the reader if he has read about the traditional food before. The same concept applies to the broader categories described at the beginning. It is easier for the audience to read about geography first to get an idea of where to place the content in their world view, and then continue to more and more specific information like environment that is inherently related to geography and easier to understand if geography was covered first. Overall, this approach starts out with the hard indisputable facts like location and population size and moves on to more variable information like international relationships that likely draw on all categories described before.
